Hello‚ It is me

1
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,550
I was wondering if after all these years You had like to met

2
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,950
To go over everything

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,760
They say that time′s supposed to heal ya

4
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,770
But I ain′t done much healing

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,560
Hello‚ can you hear me?

6
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,450
I am in California dreaming about who we used to be

7
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,660
When we were younger and free

8
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,560
I have forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

9
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,750
There′s such a difference between us

10
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:21,750
And a million miles

11
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,570
Hello from the other side

12
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,060
I must have called a thousand times

13
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,760
To tell you I am sorry for everything that I have done

14
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:46,250
But when I call you never seem to be home

15

Hello from the outside

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,060
At least I can say that I have tried

17
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,070
To tell you I am sorry for breaking your heart

18
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,260
But it don′t matter. It clearly doesn′t tear you apart anymore

19
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,760
Hello‚ how are you?

20
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,970
It is so typical of me to talk about myself. I am sorry

21
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,670
I hope that You are well

22
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,650
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

23
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,970
And It is no secret that the both of us

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,460
